### **90_meta_recursive/** - The Brain of the System
**orchestrator.py** - Central agent that routes problems and manages the ecosystem
- Routes incoming problems to appropriate specialized agents
- Creates new agents when no suitable match exists
- Maintains agent registry and performance tracking
- Provides system status and ecosystem management

**agent_creator.py** - Meta-agent that creates new specialized agents
- Analyzes requirements and generates agent specifications
- Creates complete agent code with domain-specific capabilities
- Integrates new agents into the ecosystem automatically
- Supports multiple domains: data, finance, web, ML, research, creative, automation

### **20_templates/** - Reusable Building Blocks
**base_agent.py** - Template for creating standardized agents
- Provides common interface for all agents
- Performance monitoring and metrics tracking
- Request processing pipeline with error handling
- Template generation for new agent types

**mcp_integration.py** - Integration with Model Context Protocol servers
- Connects to your existing MCP servers (filesystem, GitHub, Airtable, resume-summarizer)
- Provides unified interface for external capabilities
- Enables agents to perform file operations, database queries, etc.

### **00_foundations/** - Theoretical Framework
**01_context_engineering_principles.md** - Core concepts and theory
- Explains the foundational principles
- Context as dynamic system concept
- Meta-recursive improvement strategies
- Implementation roadmap

### **cognitive-tools/** - Advanced Reasoning Framework
**README.md** - Framework for structured reasoning and meta-cognition
- Templates for different reasoning types
- Meta-cognitive capabilities for self-improvement
- Integration patterns for complex problem solving

### **Root Level** - Entry Points and Documentation
**main.py** - Main CLI interface for the entire system
**setup.py** - Setup script for first-time initialization
**README.md** - Overview and quick start guide
**requirements.txt** - Python dependencies

## üöÄ What You Can Do Right Now

### 1. **Solve Problems Intelligently**
```bash
python main.py solve "Analyze quarterly sales trends and identify key insights"
```
The system will:
- Analyze the problem to determine domain (finance/data)
- Route to the best available agent, or
- Offer to create a specialized agent if none exists

### 2. **Create Specialized Agents on Demand**
```bash
python main.py create-agent --description "Financial risk assessment specialist"
```
This creates a complete agent with:
- Domain-specific capabilities
- Customized prompts and reasoning
- Integration with your MCP servers
- Performance tracking

### 3. **Interactive Problem Solving**
```bash
python main.py interactive
```
Provides a conversational interface where you can:
- Solve problems in natural language
- Create agents interactively
- Monitor system status
- Explore available capabilities

### 4. **System Management**
```bash
python main.py list-agents        # See all available agents
python main.py system-status      # Get ecosystem overview
```

## üîß Integration with Your Existing MCP Setup

The framework automatically integrates with your MCP servers:

### **Your Current MCP Servers:**
- **Filesystem**: File operations and directory management
- **GitHub**: Repository operations and code management
- **Airtable**: Database operations and record management
- **Resume-Summarizer**: Professional experience analysis

### **How Agents Use MCP:**
When you create agents, they can automatically:
- Read and write files using your filesystem server
- Create GitHub repositories and manage code
- Query and update Airtable databases
- Analyze resumes and professional profiles

Example agent using MCP:
```python
class DataAnalysisAgent(MCPEnabledAgent):
    def analyze_file(self, filepath):
        # Read data using filesystem MCP
        data = self.filesystem.read_file(filepath)
        
        # Analyze the data (agent's specialized capability)
        analysis = self.perform_analysis(data)
        
        # Save results using filesystem MCP
        self.filesystem.write_file("analysis_result.json", analysis)
        
        # Log to Airtable using MCP
        self.airtable.create_record("analysis_logs", {
            "file": filepath,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "agent": self.name
        })
```

## üß† Key Innovations

### **1. Meta-Recursive Agent Creation**
- System can analyze its own capabilities
- Automatically creates new agents when gaps are identified
- Agents improve through usage and feedback

### **2. Intelligent Problem Routing**
- Analyzes problem domain, complexity, and requirements
- Routes to most suitable agent based on multiple factors
- Falls back to agent creation when no match exists

### **3. Unified Agent Framework**
- All agents share common interfaces and capabilities
- Performance tracking and optimization built-in
- Easy integration with external systems via MCP

### **4. Context Engineering Principles**
- Context treated as dynamic, evolving system
- Emergence through agent collaboration
- Self-optimizing based on success patterns

## üìà Immediate Benefits

### **For You:**
- **One command solves problems**: `python main.py solve "your problem"`
- **Automatic specialization**: System creates experts for your specific needs
- **Leverages existing tools**: Works with your current MCP servers
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new capabilities and agents

### **For Your Workflow:**
- **Intelligent routing**: Problems go to the right specialist
- **Learning system**: Gets better at solving your specific types of problems  
- **Integration ready**: Connects with your existing tools and data
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new domains and capabilities
