# Meta-Recursive Context Engineering Repository

A sophisticated framework for building self-improving AI agent ecosystems that can create, orchestrate, and optimize other AI agents based on problem requirements.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This repository provides a complete framework for:
- **Intelligent Agent Creation**: Automatically generate specialized agents based on problem requirements
- **Problem Routing**: Intelligently route problems to the most appropriate agent or agent combination
- **Meta-Recursive Improvement**: Agents that can analyze, improve, and evolve themselves and other agents
- **Context Engineering**: Advanced techniques for managing and optimizing AI context and reasoning

## 🤖 Agent Ecosystem

### Core Agent Types
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Routes problems and coordinates other agents
- **Creator Agent**: Generates new specialized agents based on requirements
- **Analyzer Agent**: Analyzes existing agents and suggests improvements
- **Specialist Agents**: Domain-specific agents for particular problem types

### Integration with MCP Servers
- Filesystem operations for agent storage and management
- GitHub integration for agent versioning and collaboration
- Airtable integration for agent metadata and performance tracking
- Resume/Profile analysis for creating personalized agents

## 📚 Key Directories

- `00_foundations/` - Core theoretical concepts and patterns
- `20_templates/` - Reusable agent and system templates
- `70_agents/` - Self-contained agent implementations
- `90_meta_recursive/` - Meta-level systems for self-improvement
- `cognitive-tools/` - Advanced reasoning frameworks

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Initialize the Agent Orchestrator**:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

2. **Interactive Mode**:
   ```bash
   python main.py interactive
   ```

3. **Solve a Problem**:
   ```bash
   python main.py solve "Analyze quarterly sales trends and identify key insights"
   ```

4. **Create a Specialized Agent**:
   ```bash
   python main.py create-agent --description="Financial analysis specialist"
   ```

## 🔄 Meta-Recursive Features

- **Self-Analysis**: Agents can analyze their own performance and suggest improvements
- **Auto-Optimization**: Agents automatically optimize their own prompts and parameters
- **Collaborative Evolution**: Agents work together to solve complex multi-domain problems
- **Emergent Capabilities**: New capabilities emerge from agent interactions

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Business Analysis**: Automatically create agents for specific business domains
- **Research Assistance**: Generate specialized research agents for different fields
- **Creative Projects**: Create artistic or creative agents with specific styles or focuses
- **Technical Problem Solving**: Route technical problems to the most appropriate specialist
- **Personal Productivity**: Create personalized agents that understand your work patterns

## 🔗 Integration

This framework integrates seamlessly with:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- External APIs and databases
- GitHub for collaboration and versioning
- Cloud services for scalability

## 🚀 What Makes This Special
